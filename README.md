This project aims to visualize gray and blue whale sightings along the West Coast and how they intersect with global shipping density.

## File Descriptions:
There are three .ipynb files. They each generate a folium map that are displayed in my website blog: https://willswebsite.herokuapp.com/whales

## Installation:
Dependencies:
- [Python Version: 3.11.3]
- [branca==0.6.0]
- [folium==0.14.0]

- [numpy==1.24.3]
- [pandas==2.0.1]
- [rasterio==1.3.6]
- [shapely==2.0.1]




## Usage:
Run each .ipynb script to generate the map visualization. You may need to download the file to trust the notebook which will then show the map.

## Data:
The whale sighting data was obtained from the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) and the Marine Geospatial Ecology Lab (MGEL) at Duke University: [OBIS](https://seamap.env.duke.edu/)

The Global Shipping Density was obtained from the World Bank: [Global Shipping Traffic Density](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0037580/Global-Shipping-Traffic-Density)
